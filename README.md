Easy to experiment DifuzzRTL
============================

# Introduction

I modified the code so that you can easily perform multicore Fuzzing and check map-coverage about some of modules.


Other additional settings are needed for accurate operation such as Muticore fuzzing, but I made it simple to run.



## Setup

First of all, you can enter the Docker Container using the Docker File in difuzz-rtl directory


```
docker build -t difuzzrtl .
docker run -it --name difuzzrtl difuzzrtl:latest
```

Before fuzzing, you need to setup.

```
cd Fuzzer
. ./setup.sh
```

#### Multicore Fuzzing
> 
> Multicore Fuzzing does not work for existing open source files. 
> Therefore, I made some modifications to make it work.
>
> â€»Caution 
>   you need to set NUM_ITER over 5,000 times and can't not use Multocore over 40 cores.
>
> ```
> cd Fuzzer
> make SIM_BUILD=<build_dir> VFILE=<target> TOPLEVEL=<topmodule> NUM_ITER=<num_iter> OUT=<outdir> MULTICORE=<num_core>
> ```
> (e.g., make SIM_BUILD=sim_build_RocketTile VFILE=RocketTile_state_Muticore TOPLEVEL=RocketTile NUM_ITER=5000 OUT=out10 MUTICORE=8)




Also, I wanted to find out the versatility of DiffuzzRTL. So I tried fuzzing the fir file of another chip based on RocketTile through the open source DiffuzzRTL.
As a result, fuzzing is possible, but the Verilog file that came out after instrumentation may require some modification (such as porting).


I hope it will help others who want to study DiffuzzRTL in the future. 
  
Thank you Author, Jae-won Hur, for your great help. 
  
Also, look forward to the great honor of UNIST CSS lab.
